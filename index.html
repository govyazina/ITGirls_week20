            <div class="description">There, that dot on the right, that's the largest rock known in our Solar System. It
                is larger than every known asteroid, moon, and comet nucleus. It is larger than any other local rocky
                planet. This rock is so large its gravity makes it into a large ball that holds heavy gases near its
                surface. (It used to be the largest known rock of any type until the recent discoveries of large dense
                planets orbiting other stars.) The Voyager 1 spacecraft took the featured picture -- famously called
                Pale Blue Dot -- of this giant space rock in 1990 from the outer Solar System. Today, this rock starts
                another orbit around its parent star, for roughly the 5 billionth time, spinning over 350 times during
                each trip. Happy Gregorian Calendar New Year to all inhabitants of this rock we call Earth.
